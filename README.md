## Included Games

### 1. **Simon Says**
- **Type:** Memory Game  
- **Goal:** Repeat a randomly growing LED sequence. One wrong move resets the game.

### 2. **Whack-a-LED**
- **Type:** Reflex Game  
- **Goal:** Hit the button matching the LED before time runs out. Speeds up over time. Win animation triggers on a score threshold.

### 3. **LED Chase**
- **Type:** Timing Game  
- **Goal:** Press the button when the LED "chase" passes over it. The pattern loops in direction, and difficulty increases with score.

### 4. **Code Cracker**
- **Type:** Logic Puzzle  
- **Goal:** Guess a secret 3-button code. LEDs indicate correct positions or correct buttons in wrong positions (like a hardware Wordle).
