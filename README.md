## Included Games

1. Simon Says: memory game where a sequence is shown and you have to press the exact same one

2. Whack-a-LED: click the corresponding button to the led before the timer runs out (like Whack a Mole)

3. LED Chase: use the D-pad shaped buttons to navigate to the glowing led as fast as possible

4. Code Cracker: try to guess a randomly code like a detective
